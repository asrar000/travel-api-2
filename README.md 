🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Docker and Docker Compose

Node.js (if running without Docker)

PostgreSQL client (optional)

Quick Start with Docker
Clone the repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/asrar000/travel-api-2.git
cd travel-api-2
Set up environment variables

Update the .env file with your API keys and database credentials

Start the application

bash
docker-compose up
Initialize the database

bash
# The init-db.sh script should run automatically via Docker Compose
# Or run manually if needed
Manual Setup (Without Docker)
Install dependencies

bash
npm install
Set up PostgreSQL database

bash
# Create database and user
psql -U postgres -f schema.sql
Configure environment

bash
cp .env.example .env  # If an example exists
# Edit .env with your credentials
Start the server

bash
node server.js
🗄️ Database Schema
The database schema is defined in schema.sql. Based on the commit history mentioning "flight details," this API likely includes:

Flight information tables

Travel booking data

User management

Itinerary tracking

🔧 API Endpoints
Specific endpoints will be documented as the API develops. Currently working on flight details functionality based on commit history.
